# Odin Project - Weather App

## Who am I? What is this?

Hello, my name is Joviscab and this is part of my learning to code journey!

This project is called Weather App and is part of the Javascript Course of The Odin Project. The idea of this project is to put to practice all the Asynchronous JavaScript and APIs knowledge that I have acquired until now. In this project I am going to build a Weather App Webpage, following the instructions of Odin's lesson! The idea is to use all the knowledge that I have acquired until know to make my code a bit better!

## Skills

With this project my idea is to check the Asynchronous JavaScript and APIs skills that I have learned until now, as well as using it as an exercise to remember all the lessons until this point.

## If you are reading this

Thank you for your interest! I'm still here, going even deeper in Javascript, practicing, practicing, practicing. After the last project (Todo List) the sky is the limit!
